The cache will be filled up with persistent room surrogates when a client requests the list of rooms through service discovery. The cache will keep all the surrogates in memory for an hour. If the cache's entries weren't used in an hour, they will be removed from memory. Whenever a persistent room is removed from memory (because all the occupants have left), the cache is cleared. But if a persistent room is loaded from the database then the entry for that room in the cache is removed. Note: Since the cache contains an entry for each room surrogate and the clearing algorithm is based on the usage of each entry, it's possible that some entries are removed while others don't thus generating that the provided list of discovered rooms won't be complete. However, this possibility is low since the clients will most of the time ask for all the cache entries and then ask for a particular entry. Anyway, if this possibility happens the cache will be reset the next time that a persistent room is removed from memory."}
